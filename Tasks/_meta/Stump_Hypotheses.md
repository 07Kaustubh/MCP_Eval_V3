**Predictions (from Hardness_Plan.md):**
1. [HIGH] Root-cause miscategorization on 2 of 3 top vendors (GraniteRack VEN-012-753165, TimeLedger VEN-010-514242, BeaconPay VEN-033) — Mechanism: L8 three-link chain (SAP -> Linear -> email) + L11 structured-source skip + L14 correct observation / wrong conclusion
2. [HIGH] Acme Cloud scope reported as "not found" instead of "addendum + change order" (doc_eb7cb30c59bd4f03 + doc_2d85ac5a698745c5) — Mechanism: L2 structured-DB skip + L9 universe-grounded gotcha
3. [MED-HIGH] Authority-figure dismissal: agent defers to Daniel-Jones "routing-fixed" Slack thread reply and de-escalates — Mechanism: L1 latching + Learnings-L9 authority dismissal + L12 thread-reply blindness
4. [MED] Misses at least one age-vs-dollars trade-off vendor (BeaconPay) — Mechanism: L1 latching + L13 first-framing trap

**Actuals (from S4_verdict.md):**
- AF rubrics: 8 legitimate (6 systematic at 5/6 fail + R17 at 4/6 + R22 at 3/6); 1 borderline judge variance (R6 at 4/6)
- R2 — Slack omits GraniteRack stale SOW (procurement)
- R3 — Slack omits TimeLedger missing credit memo (AP)
- R9 — Email omits GraniteRack void-and-rebill partner sign-off
- R10 — Email omits TimeLedger partner sign-off
- R15 — Analytical miss on GraniteRack SOW-2024-GR-rev3 vs SOW-2025-GR-rev1 supersession
- R16 — Analytical miss on TimeLedger $24,475.25 missing credit memo
- R17 — Pinecrest VEN-006-193120 small-dollar / high-age active dispute missed
- R22 — Routing-fix-did-not-hold conclusion hedged in face of Daniel-Jones dismissal
- R6 — Linear comment narrowed to filtered subset (215 or 214 invoices) instead of full 320/320 systemic null-approver claim

**Hit rate:** 2/3 testable (Pred 1 CONFIRMED, Pred 3 CONFIRMED, Pred 2 OVER-PREDICTED, Pred 4 NOT TESTABLE — BeaconPay anchor removed in FINAL phase).

**Misses (predicted, did not fail):**
- Pred 2 Acme scope = "not found" trap: failed only 1/6 runs (Run 2). The explicit "addendum and at least one change order, so we have multiple documents to check, not a single letter" prompt language and Northstar-vs-Acme contrast made the trap visible. Worth keeping the lever but expect HIGH-confidence Pred-2-shaped predictions to land at MED in practice when the prompt names the doc-kind variants.

**Atom-validation correction (Phase 3 cross-check, 2026-06-21):**
- The Hardness_Plan claimed the Daniel Jones "routing patched last sprint" dismissal lived as a Slack thread reply in C010. Phase 3 universe verification found this is NOT in the Slack record — Daniel's actual C010 reply attributes routing fix ownership to Mateo (npc_024) as in-progress, not as completed. The "patched last sprint" framing lives in the PROMPT itself (`5_Prompt.txt`), not in Slack. The L1 + Learnings-L9 authority-dismissal lever still fires (R22 failed 3/6 runs as predicted at MED-HIGH) but the operative mechanism is "prompt-planted hearsay vs universe-disproving evidence", not "thread-reply dismissal". For the lever catalog: distinguish prompt-side authority planting (high yield, agent reads prompt as ground truth) from Slack-thread-reply authority planting (also effective but requires L12 thread-reply blindness). The same lever name covers both; the planting surface should be recorded per-task.

**Post-patch orphan count over-prediction:** Hardness_Plan estimated "8-12 post-patch orphans" to drive R22 pressure. Actual: 6 post-patch (invoice_date > 2026-05-08) null-approver invoices total (VEN-028-492596 + 3 MetroShield + 2 others). The smaller-than-predicted count did not reduce R22 effectiveness because the operative signal is the EXISTENCE of any post-patch orphans, not the count. For future tasks: a post-patch orphan count >= 3 is sufficient atom mass; do not over-estimate.

**Surprises (failed, did not predict):**
- R17 Pinecrest small-dollar active dispute (4/6 fail). Mechanism: "attention attrition on small-dollar / high-age outliers when compound (age x $) ranking dominates the framing." The compound lens fixes the dollar bias but introduces a different attention sink — agents fall back onto the visual top-5 ranking and lose the items whose dollar footprint is sub-threshold even though their age is in-band. This is a NEW lever pattern not in the current playbook.

**Lesson for the lever catalog:** Add a 12th lever — **"small-dollar long-aged outlier under compound ranking"**. Mechanism: when the prompt mandates compound (age x $) ranking, small-dollar items with very long age fall below the visual cut even though they satisfy the age-band filter. To exploit, plant 1-2 named outliers in the universe whose age is the highest (or near-highest) but whose dollar is sub-$5K, and write a rubric that names the outlier specifically. Verified atom on this task: Pinecrest Workflow Works VEN-006-193120 ($1,040.63, ~338 days, brookfield) failed 4/6 runs.

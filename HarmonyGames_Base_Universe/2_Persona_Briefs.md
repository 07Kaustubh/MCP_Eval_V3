# Harmony Games — Persona Briefs

> Universe date: **February 28, 2026**. The exact 17 task-visible identities are in [`4_Persona_ACL_Roster.json`](4_Persona_ACL_Roster.json); [`../Docs/14_Persona_ACL.md`](../Docs/14_Persona_ACL.md) controls their read visibility. The "active work / relationships / open threads" below describe what people do across the storylines. Additional people can appear in service data without being selectable task personas.

> **Tool and ACL clarification:** `HarmonyGames_Base_Universe/6_Server_Tools_Details.json` defines capabilities for exactly 11 services: Gmail, GDrive, GitHub, Slack, GCal, GDocs, GSheets, GSlides, Trello, Linear, and Contacts. Gmail, Slack, GCal, GDrive, GDocs, GSheets, and GSlides reads are persona-scoped; the other four services are unscoped. Writes are outside Persona ACL scope. Firebase, BigQuery, Metabase, App Store Connect, Google Play, AppLovin, Singular, Figma, Carta, CRM, Airtable, QuickBooks, and Stripe references below are narrative systems, vendors, topics, or artifacts—not directly callable tools. Gmail has no send/reply/compose capability.

## How to read these

Each brief follows a consistent shape:
- **Active work** — what they own day to day
- **Key relationships** — internal + external
- **Open threads** — live storylines they sit on
- **Recent activity** — artifacts they've touched

---

## Task-visible ACL personas (17)

Use the roster's exact email for identity configuration; never derive it from a
name. Universe Explorer is author god-mode, while the Agent Runner and Run
Verifiers share the same required persona and scoped read view. There is no
task-visible Finance persona or CFO.

> **Source-data cleanup notes** (not Persona ACL roster values): `tim steudler@example.com` → `tim.steudler@example.com`; `josh dempsey@example.com` → `josh.dempsey@example.com`; `olivia (person_6062)@example.com` is a placeholder. Calvin Price's source department shows as `VFX) / Engineering` (a split artifact) — the exact ACL roster value is **Engineering**. `Marcus` and `Marcus Lee` share `marcus.lee@harmonygames.co` in source service data — a storyline collision to reconcile.

## 2. Initial QC findings (pre-fix)

### 2.1 Prompt (`5_Prompt.txt`)
| Sub-Dimension | Rating | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| Unique Ground Truth | 4 → 5 (re-graded) | Initially flagged as borderline because "one of the items" relies on universe to pin the contested item. **Re-graded to 5** after verifying all 6 trajectory runs converged on the Datadog reclass JE — universe makes the answer unique. |
| Prompt Clarity & Specificity | 4 → 5 (re-graded) | Initially flagged borderline; on review, intent is crystal-clear and only one minor assumption (identifying the contested item via investigation) — that fits the Pass band. |
| All other sub-dimensions | 5 | Pass. |

**No edits required to the prompt.** Natural partner voice, no anti-patterns, no factual claims, multi-service investigation required, investigation feeds action.

### 2.2 Oracle Events (`6_Oracle_Events.txt`)
- File **truncated** at original line 14 mid-sentence: `"Verify that the proposed treatment is consistent with the"`.
- Only 3 partial OEs existed.
- Missing critical-path coverage for: validating supporting AP/GL evidence, examining the SAB 99 memo in Records Vault, BlackLine close-package state, prior-period precedent comparison, recommendation synthesis, documentation update, stakeholder communication.

### 2.3 Rubrics (`7_Rubrics.json`)
11 rubrics — 10 Outcome + 1 Process.

| # | Issue | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | typo "discoverd" | Non-Failing wording |
| R2 | `"The Aagent determines whether the current accounting treatment or recommendation and evidence."` — grammatically incomplete, not a coherent predicate | **Major — Incorrect Criteria** |
| R4 | "The Agent **compare**" (wrong verb form) | Non-Failing wording |
| R6 | `"Updates the appropriate review record documentation file, or working paper…"` — no specific documentation target named; verifier runs confirm 6/6 fail with judge interpretation drift | **Major — Criteria Not Self-Contained** |
| R7 | typo "reviewd"; cascading failure when R6 fails | Non-Failing wording |
| R8 | `"Communicates the review outcome to the appropriate stakeholders."` — does not embed Andrea/Jones/Brenda emails | **Major — Criteria Not Self-Contained** |
| R10 | typo "evidence **f** a recurring" (missing "o") | Non-Failing wording |
| R11 | Process — passes V3 three-condition test (ordering, can't be captured by Outcome, behavioral verification) | None |

**Pre-fix aggregate:** Major = 3 / 11 = **27%** → `[Fail – 10%+ Major Rubric Errors]`.

### 2.4 Trajectory (from `8_Verifier_Fails.txt`)
- 6/6 runs completed (no errors). ✅
- Pass@1 = 0/6 (best 9/11) → `[Pass – pass@1 ≤ 40%]`. ✅
- Avg tool calls ≥ 15 (Run 1 = 45, Run 6 = 139). ✅
- Persistent failures: R6 (6/6 fail), R7 (5/6 fail), R8 (3/6 fail) — these are genuine model failures **plus** rubric-phrasing inconsistency. Fixing R6/R8 to be self-contained removes the rubric-quality contribution and isolates the real model gap.

---

## 3. Changes applied

### 3.1 `5_Prompt.txt` — one surgical edit (Truthfulness)

**Issue surfaced in second-pass audit:** the opening sentence `"Andrea has asked for partner sign-off on a close package, but before I put my name on it I'd like an independent view."` contradicts the universe. `Brookfield_Base_Universe/1_Summary.md:152` states **"Andrea Phil certifies Acme's monthly close package"** — she is the certifying partner who signs Acme's close herself. There are no Andrea↔Matthew artifacts in the universe in which Andrea asks Matthew to sign Acme's May close. Per `7_QC_Spec_Doc1.json` Truthfulness band, that's **1 minor factual error → Non-Fail (3-4)**, blocking 5/5.

| | Text |
|---|---|
| Before (L1) | `Andrea has asked for partner sign-off on a close package, but before I put my name on it I'd like an independent view.` |
| After (L1) | `Andrea is wrapping up her certification of the May Acme close package and I want to give it an independent partner read on one of the judgment items before she finalizes it.` |

**Why this works:**
- Aligns with the universe (Andrea = certifying partner who signs herself).
- Reframes Matthew as the independent partner peer-reviewer on a judgment item — a defensible partnership pattern, plausible for an AS Partner even when Northstar-weighted in his other scenarios.
- Removes the false "Andrea has asked" / "before I put my name on it" claims.
- Doesn't pre-solve: "one of the judgment items" mirrors the L3 anchor "one of the items that moved during the close" — agent still has to discover which item via investigation.
- Downstream is untouched: all rubrics, OEs, and the Datadog reclass investigation path stay identical. Andrea, Jones, Brenda remain the relevant stakeholders for R8/R9.

**Dimension impact:** Truthfulness 3-4 → **5**.

### 3.1a Findings retained as PASS without edit (per user direction)

| Finding | Dimension | Disposition | Why retained without edit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prompt's partner-judgment framing also fits "Executive / Partner Oversight" (#9) | Business Function | Locked as Accounting Operations | User direction: business function, persona, and universe data are fixed. Defensible as 5/5: the agent's actual work (JE review, AP investigation, reconciliations, prior-period analysis, close package documentation) is core Accounting Operations — partner sign-off is a stage of the close cycle, not a separate function. |
| Matthew Li's 14 universe scenarios are Northstar-weighted; not a routine Acme co-signer | Persona | Cosmetic only — stays 5/5 | Per `7_QC_Spec_Doc1.json` Persona note (03/24): prompt aligning with multiple personas does not penalize so long as the assigned persona is also applicable. AS Partner doing peer review on a sensitive Acme judgment item is plausible for Matthew. |
| Universe data | Universe | Locked | User direction: `3_UniverseDataForThisTask.json` not editable. Verified all required entities (Datadog reclass JE, Andrea, Jones, Brenda, SAB 99 memo, BlackLine state, prior-period precedent) exist via the 6 verifier-run trajectories. |

### 3.2 `6_Oracle_Events.txt` — fully rewritten

**Before:** 3 partial OEs, file truncated mid-sentence at line 14.

**After:** 9 OEs covering the full critical path:

| OE | Step | Drives rubric |
|---|---|---|
| OE 1 | Identify Datadog reclass JE (`je_1ce7247752034cbc`, $28,400, DR 521000 / CR 500000) as contested item | R1 |
| OE 2 | Trace review history across email/Slack/messaging — Andrea, Jones, Brenda — surface competing explanations | R1, R3 |
| OE 3 | Validate supporting accounting evidence (Oracle GL JE detail, SAP AP Datadog history, prior-period account 500000 activity, ~$340K cumulative) | R2, R3 |
| OE 4 | Examine SAB 99 memo (`doc_fc23774ed7d84f3f`) and supporting workpapers in Records Vault | R2, R3 |
| OE 5 | Assess BlackLine close-package state (reconciliations, close tasks, review notes, BD3 lock consistency) | R3 |
| OE 6 | Compare against prior-period precedent (FP-2025-09 KPI-sensitive, April 2026 Helix Bio context) | R4, R10 |
| OE 7 | Synthesize partner-level disposition (supportable / hold / remediate) | R2, R5, R10 |
| OE 8 | Update the review record (Records Vault memo, BlackLine review note, or JE annotation) | R6, R7 |
| OE 9 | Communicate disposition to Andrea, Jones, Brenda — after review is complete | R8, R9, R11 |

**Why:** Closes the truncation gap and creates 1:1 backing for every rubric. Verified each tool name against the universe MCP server inventory. Verified each entity/document ID against `8_Verifier_Fails.txt` (universe-grounded).

**Dimension impact:** OE Completeness 3 → **5**; OE Accuracy 5 → **5**.

### 3.3 `7_Rubrics.json` — 6 of 11 rubrics edited; structure preserved

| # | Change | Severity addressed |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Embedded JE id (`je_1ce7247752034cbc`), display id, $28,400, DR 521000 / CR 500000, Acme Cloud, FP-2026-05. Fixed "discoverd" → "discovered". | Tightens self-containment + typo |
| R2 | Rewrote incoherent title to: `"The Agent reaches a clear conclusion in the final response on whether the current accounting treatment of the Datadog reclass is supportable, and grounds that conclusion in the underlying evidence reviewed."` Fixed "Aagent". | **Major — Incorrect Criteria** → resolved |
| R3 | Anchored to "Datadog reclass and the surrounding Acme Cloud FP-2026-05 close package" for context. | Tightens self-containment |
| R4 | Embedded the three specific precedents (FP-2025-09, prior-period Datadog 500000 coding, April 2026 Helix Bio). Fixed "compare" → "compares". | Tightens self-containment + grammar |
| R5 | Minor tightening — added "partner-level" framing and explicit recommendation options (sign / hold / remediate / escalate). | Clarity |
| R6 | Embedded the three valid documentation targets — Records Vault memo, BlackLine review note on the related Acme Cloud reconciliation/close task, or annotation on `je_1ce7247752034cbc`. Tool names moved from criterion to evidence field (V3 agent-centric phrasing rule). | **Major — Not Self-Contained** → resolved |
| R7 | Fixed "reviewd" → "reviewed"; clarified the artifact is the one from R6 (Records Vault memo, BlackLine review note, or JE annotation). | Typo + clarity |
| R8 | Embedded the three stakeholders with full emails: Andrea Phil (`andrea.phil@brookfieldcpas.com`), Jones Harrison (`jones.harrison@brookfieldcpas.com`), Brenda Abbas (`brenda.abbas@brookfieldcpas.com`). Allowed email / Messaging / Slack channels (method-agnostic flexibility). Tool names in evidence only. | **Major — Not Self-Contained** → resolved |
| R9 | Cleaned punctuation (`"key findings, recommendation, and required next steps"`). | Wording |
| R10 | Fixed "evidence **f** a" → "evidence **of** a". Added concrete pattern example (Datadog AP auto-routing default coding to 500000 across FY25). | Typo + tightens self-containment |
| R11 | Unchanged — passes V3 three-condition test (ordering verification). | None |

**Post-fix issue tally:** Major = 0, Moderate = 0, Minor = 0, Non-Failing wording = 0. → **Overall Rubric Quality: 5/5** (Pass condition: "<5% Minor, zero Major/Moderate").

### 3.4 Second-pass audit — OE & rubric tool/ground-truth accuracy

**Audit surfaced 9 issues in the OE file and 2 in the rubrics that the first-pass V3-framework check did not catch.** All cross-checked against `Brookfield_Base_Universe/8_Server_Tools_Details.json` (real tool inventory).

| # | OE / Rubric | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | OE 1, 2 | `slack_search_messages` — phantom tool | Replaced with `slack_conversations_search_messages` |
| 2 | OE 3 | `sap_subledger_get_subledger_transactions` — phantom tool | Replaced with `sap_subledger_list_subledger_transactions` (+ `sap_subledger_get_subledger_transaction_detail` for single-tx drill-in) |
| 3 | OE 8 (now OE 7) | `records_vault_create_document_version` — phantom tool | Replaced with `records_vault_add_document_version` |
| 4 | OE 8 (now OE 7) | `oracle_gl_update_journal_entry` — phantom tool | Removed; no JE-update verb exists |
| 5 | OE 8 (now OE 7) | `oracle_gl_add_journal_entry_attachment` — phantom tool | Removed; attachments are added at JE creation time only |
| 6 | OE 1, 3, 5, 6 | Phantom parameter names (`entity=`, `account=`, `vendor=`, `periods=`, `period=`, `id=`) on tools that don't accept them | Rewritten with real param names: `period_id`, `entry_id`, `vendor_id`, `entity_id`, `gl_account_number`, `recon_id`, `account_number`, `posting_date_from/to`, `sap_module` |
| 7 | OE 5 | `blackline_list_review_notes` / `blackline_get_audit_trail` framed period-scoped — tools require `recon_id` / `reconciliation_id` / `close_task_id` | Rewritten as per-recon lookups; period-scoped close-status info now correctly routed via `blackline_get_close_status_dashboard(period_id)` and `blackline_list_close_tasks(period_id)` |
| 8 | OE 1, 3 (+ R1) | JE display id `JE-acme_cloud-FP-2026-05-0044` missed the double-slug — universe truth is `JE-acme_cloud-acme_cloud_FP-2026-05-0044` (display id includes the full `period_id`, which itself is `acme_cloud_FP-2026-05`) | Corrected display id everywhere — OE 1, 3 and R1 |
| 9 | OE 1 | "Andrea Phil is awaiting partner sign-off" — Andrea already signed off 2026-06-10 (universe `today` = 2026-06-12) | Reframed: "contested item Matthew is reviewing before Andrea finalizes her certification" — aligns with the prompt rewrite and `1_Summary.md:152` |
| 10 | OE 4 | `doc_fc23774ed7d84f3f` was framed as a standalone SAB 99 memo — universe truth is it's the **materiality-analysis package (MAP)** with an embedded SAB 99 memo section | Reframed across OE 4 and R7 to MAP-with-embedded-SAB-99 |
| 11 | OE 5 | "BD3 lock-status inconsistency between Oracle GL and BlackLine" claim made without the tools that would actually retrieve Oracle-side lock state | Added `oracle_gl_get_fiscal_period(period_id="acme_cloud_FP-2026-05")` and `oracle_gl_get_close_calendar(period_id="acme_cloud_FP-2026-05")` to give the BD3-lock claim concrete evidentiary backing |
| 12 | OE 7 (original) | Pure reasoning / synthesis with no tool call — per `Evals/2_OE_Eval.md` Phase 1.1, not a valid OE step | Removed (renumbered: 9 OEs → 8 OEs). Synthesis happens naturally in the final response and is graded against R2 / R5 / R10 — no dedicated OE needed |
| 13 | R6 | Listed phantom "annotating journal entry je_1ce7247752034cbc with the review conclusion" as a third valid documentation path — no Oracle GL tool supports post-creation JE annotation | Dropped the JE-annotation path. Three valid paths now: Records Vault upload (linked to JE or close package), `records_vault_add_document_version` on `doc_fc23774ed7d84f3f`, or BlackLine review note. Evidence field also cleaned of phantom tool names. |
| 14 | R7 | Same JE-annotation phantom carried in the artifact-list parenthetical | Updated to mirror R6's three valid paths |

**Post-second-pass state:**
- OE count: 8 (was 9 — removed pure-synthesis OE).
- All tool names verified against `8_Server_Tools_Details.json` — zero phantoms remain (`grep` verified clean on both OE file and rubrics file for all 5 phantom names).
- All param names match real tool signatures.
- Period_id and JE display id formats match universe convention (double-slug `acme_cloud_FP-2026-05` / `JE-acme_cloud-acme_cloud_FP-2026-05-0044`).
- Universe ground truth aligned: Andrea = certifying partner; `doc_fc23774ed7d84f3f` = MAP with embedded SAB 99.

**Dimension impact:** OE Accuracy 3 (Non-Fail) → **5**; OE Completeness stays **5** (removing the invalid synthesis OE actually tightens completeness — no rubric loses coverage because R2/R5/R10 are Outcome 2.1 graded against the final response, not against an OE).

### 3.5 Third-pass audit — task-data alignment of OE filter values & precedent references

**Audit cross-referenced OEs against the merged task universe data** (base + `3_UniverseDataForThisTask.json`) — caught 6 issues where tool calls were syntactically valid but the embedded filter/identifier values would return zero results against the actual task data, plus an acronym mismatch.

| # | OE / Rubric | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | OE 3 | `oracle_gl_list_transactions(account_number="500000", period_id=...)` — task data adds 0 rows to `ogl_transactions`; the call returns nothing. Verified: agent must pivot to `oracle_gl_list_journal_entries` (there are 2 Acme FP-2026-04 JEs touching 500000 that ARE in task data). | Removed the `oracle_gl_list_transactions` leg. Replaced with a pivot to `oracle_gl_list_journal_entries` across FY25/early-FY26 Acme periods + `oracle_gl_get_journal_entry` to inspect JE lines hitting account 500000. |
| 2 | OE 3 (SAP Datadog) | 0 of 987 SAP AP invoices mention "Datadog"; 0 subledger transactions; no Datadog vendor exists. | **Kept as-is, defensible.** The OE's verification framing already says "verify whether the asserted underlying invoice / AP-autoroute history actually exists." Tightened the language to "If no Datadog vendor or invoice surfaces, the absence is itself the evidence" so the OE explicitly captures the absence-as-finding outcome. |
| 3 | OE 4 | Filter values `related_resource_type="fiscal_period" or "journal_entry"` and `related_resource_id="acme_cloud_FP-2026-05" or "je_1ce7247752034cbc"` — the MAP doc's actual metadata is `related_resource_type="memo"`, `related_resource_id="acme-cloud-fp-2026-05-final-map-close-support"`. The OE's filter returns 0 hits. | Replaced filter values with the actual `related_resource_type="memo"` + `related_resource_id="acme-cloud-fp-2026-05-final-map-close-support"`. |
| 4 | OE 4 | Relied on `entity_id="acme_cloud"` param. While the tool schema lists `entity_id`, the user's audit indicates it doesn't actually filter behavior on this tool. | De-emphasized; the `related_resource_type` + `related_resource_id` combination is the working discovery path. |
| 5 | OE 4 / R6 / R7 | Called the MAP doc the "materiality-analysis package (MAP)" — actual universe document title is **"Final Management Accounts Package with Embedded Datadog SAB 99 Memo"**. MAP stands for **Management Accounts Package**, not Materiality Analysis Package. The doc *contains* a SAB 99 materiality memo, but the package itself is the management accounts package. | Acronym corrected in OE 4 and both rubrics (R6, R7): "Final Management Accounts Package (MAP = Management Accounts Package) ... which contains an embedded Datadog SAB 99 materiality memo section." |
| 6 | OE 6 | `records_vault_list_documents` for FP-2025-09 returns 0 docs; the "FP-2025-09 KPI-sensitive deferred-revenue precedent" framing overstates what's in task data. Task data DOES add 5 non-routine FP-2025-09 reclasses including **JE-acme_cloud-FP-2025-09-0041 "Cloud infrastructure spend" reclass** — which is actually a directly analogous precedent for a cost reclass. | Removed the empty Records Vault leg. Replaced with a concrete `oracle_gl_list_journal_entries(period_id="acme_cloud_FP-2025-09")` + `oracle_gl_get_journal_entry` flow pointing at JE-acme_cloud-FP-2025-09-0041 ("Cloud infrastructure spend") as the named precedent. Tightened R4 precedent example to reference the same JE. |
| 7 | R4 | Same "FP-2025-09 KPI-sensitive precedent" language — loose against task data. | R4 example tightened to "FP-2025-09 reclass precedent JE-acme_cloud-FP-2025-09-0041 ('Cloud infrastructure spend' reclass)" — concrete, task-data-grounded reference. |

**Post-third-pass state:**
- All OE filter/identifier values trace to actual rows in the merged task data.
- Phantom-tool grep extended to include `oracle_gl_list_transactions`: still clean.
- MAP acronym is "Management Accounts Package" everywhere it appears (OE 4, R6, R7); zero "materiality-analysis" references remain.
- R4 precedent example pinned to a concrete task-data JE.
- Rubric set: still 11 rubrics, 10 Outcome + 1 Process, 0 Major / 0 Moderate / 0 Minor / 0 wording.

**Dimension impact:** OE Accuracy holds at **5** (no longer leans on empty tables or wrong filter values); OE Completeness holds at **5**; Rubric Overall Quality holds at **5** (acronym + precedent tightening were precision improvements, not severity-bearing fixes).

### 3.6 Fourth-pass audit — V2 QC OE style conformance

**Audit compared the OE file against all 10 V2 QC task OE files** (`[V2] QC_Tasks/Task1.../Oracle_Events.txt` through `Task10.../Oracle_Events.txt`). Two convention violations surfaced.

**V2 OE conventions (verified across all 10 sample tasks):**
- **Single flowing paragraph per OE** — no sub-bullets, no numbered sub-steps.
- **No `→` arrow sub-bullets** — all 10 V2 tasks have **0** arrows.
- **No em-dashes** — 9 of 10 V2 tasks have **0** em-dashes; only Task 5 has 4 (outlier).
- **Tool names inline as natural language** — patterns like `"using mortgage_los_search_loans"`, `"Call X with Y"`, `"via send_email"`.
- **Parameter values inline as natural-language phrases** — `"with query terms related to 'Tyler' or 'underwater' (or similar)"`.
- **"OE N: " prefix** dominant (8 of 10); Task 10 uses plain `"1."` numbering. Both accepted.

**Violations in our task (pre-fix):**

| File | Violation | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `6_Oracle_Events.txt` | `→` arrow sub-bullets across multiple sub-steps per OE | 29 arrows |
| `6_Oracle_Events.txt` | em-dashes (U+2014) | 6 |
| `7_Rubrics.json` | em-dashes in R6 title, R6 evidence, R8 title | 3 |
| `5_Prompt.txt` | em-dashes | 0 (already clean) |

**Fixes applied:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `6_Oracle_Events.txt` | Fully rewritten in V2 style. Each of the 8 OEs is now a single flowing paragraph. All 29 `→` arrows removed and the sub-step content folded into the paragraph. All 6 em-dashes replaced with commas, parentheses, or natural prose ("for example", "given that", colon-introduction). Tool names and parameters are inline as natural-language phrases. Content preserved 1:1 — same tools, same parameters, same expected discoveries. |
| `7_Rubrics.json` | R6 title: em-dash before the path list replaced with "by one of the following paths:". R6 evidence: em-dashes around the parenthetical replaced with literal parentheses. R8 title: em-dashes around the stakeholder list replaced with parentheses. No semantic change. |

**Post-fix validation (grep across all 3 files):**
- 0 em-dashes (U+2014 or U+2013) in prompt, OEs, or rubrics.
- 0 `→` arrows.
- Rubrics JSON still valid: 11 rubrics, 10 Outcome + 1 Process.
- OE count: 8 (unchanged).
- All tool names, parameters, IDs, and expected values preserved.

**Dimension impact:** No QC-spec dimension changes (V2 style conformance is not itself a scored sub-dimension), but the task now matches the visual/structural craft of the QC-passed V2 sample set, which auditors use as a reference benchmark.

### 3.7 Fifth-pass audit — V2 QC rubric conformance + V3-strict cleanup

**Audit compared the rubrics file against all 10 V2 QC task rubric files** (235 rubrics total). Findings:

**V2 rubric schema (observed across all 10 tasks):**
```json
{
  "id": "<UUID>",
  "title": "<criterion>",
  "annotations": {
    "evidence": "...",
    "justification": "...",
    "rubric_category": "outcome"
  }
}
```

**My schema (kept):**
```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "category": "outcome",
  "justification": "...",
  "evidence": "..."
}
```

Schema difference noted (no `id`, flat instead of nested under `annotations`, `category` instead of `rubric_category`) — kept as-is because the active V3 framework documents (`Evals/3_Rubrics_Eval.md`, `Docs/2_Rubrics_V3_Guidelines.md`) do not mandate the V2 storage shape; only the content/style conventions are evaluated. If a downstream platform requires the V2 shape, a mechanical wrapper will suffice and the content is correct as-written.

**V2-style content conventions present in V2 but penalized under V3 (kept V3-strict, not adopted):**

| V2 convention | V3 rule | My choice |
|---|---|---|
| `"An email was sent (via send_email)"` — passive voice + tool name in title | Agent-Centric Phrasing: "The Agent + verb"; no tool names in criterion | V3 (no tool names; agent subject) |
| `[email@domain.com](mailto:email@domain.com)` markdown links in title | Not required; plain text is fine | Plain text |

**Style violations in my rubrics (pre-fix this round):**

| Line | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 24 (R4 evidence) | `"at least one specific prior example"` — weakening quantifier; V3 Rubrics-Eval Phase 2.7 #5 flags "at least N of M" as reward-hackable when GT is enumerable | Replaced with `"one of the listed prior examples"` — now strict closed-set selection ("must be one of") |
| 45 (R8 title) | `"at minimum Andrea Phil ... Jones Harrison ... and Brenda Abbas"` — `"at minimum"` is the same weakening pattern under a different name | Dropped the `"at minimum"` qualifier; the three stakeholders are now the required set in plain prose. Agent can include more recipients but the rubric is strict on these three |
| 53 (R9 justification) | `"Stakeholders need enough context"` — `"enough"` is on the V3 banned-subjective-words list (`Evals/3_Rubrics_Eval.md` Phase 2.5) | Rewrote to `"Stakeholders need the findings, recommendation, and next steps"` — concrete enumeration |

**Post-fix validation (grep across rubrics file):**
- 0 occurrences of `at least`, `at minimum`, `at a minimum`, `or more`, `or fewer`
- 0 em-dashes (U+2014 / U+2013)
- 0 other weakening patterns (`roughly`, `something like`, `some of`, `many of`, `several`, `a few`, `may include`, `might include`)
- 0 V3-banned subjective words (`enough`, `professional`, `thorough`, `helpful`, `appropriate`, `good`, `well`, `comprehensive`, `sufficient`, `reasonable`, `adequate`, `properly`, `correctly`, `accurately`)
- Rubrics JSON valid: 11 rubrics, 10 Outcome + 1 Process

**Benchmark comparison:** V2 Task 1 (representative QC-passed reference) has 14 instances of `"at least"` and 3 em-dashes in evidence/justification fields. My V3-strict rubric set is now cleaner than the V2 reference benchmark on both axes.

**Dimension impact:** Rubric Overall Quality holds at **5** (the weakening quantifiers would have been **Overly Broad – Moderate** under V3 rubrics-eval Phase 4 thresholds if left in; their removal preserves the 0 Major / 0 Moderate state).

### 3.8 V3 compliance double-check on edited rubrics
- ✅ All criteria written as `"The Agent + verb + context"` (no `"The email…"`, `"The response…"`, `"The model…"`).
- ✅ Zero tool names in criterion text. Tool names appear only in evidence/justification (allowed).
- ✅ Self-contained: every entity, email, JE id, account, period, document id embedded in criterion text.
- ✅ Atomic: bundled facts are tightly coupled attributes of the same artifact (R1 issue+positions; R7 four content elements of one document; R9 four content elements of one communication). No independent actions bundled.
- ✅ Category balance: 10 Outcome + 1 Process. Outcome > Process. ✓
- ✅ Process rubric (R11) passes the three-condition test: ordering between actions can't be captured by Outcome alone; required by every valid path; describes behavior verification, not an execution trace.
- ✅ Method-agnostic flexibility preserved where the prompt left method open (R6: three documentation paths; R8: three communication channels).

## 4. Projected final scoring (all dimensions)

| Dimension | Sub-Dimension | Pre-fix | Post-fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prompt** | Unique Ground Truth | 4 | **5** (universe convergence) |
| | Feasibility | 5 | 5 |
| | Explicit Tool Mention | 5 | 5 |
| | Clarity & Specificity | 4 | **5** |
| | Contrived / Unnatural | 5 | 5 |
| | Truthfulness | 3-4 (Non-Fail — 1 minor factual error: false "Andrea has asked for sign-off" premise) | **5** (premise rewritten to align with `1_Summary.md:152` — Andrea is the certifying partner) |
| | Tool Use & Cross-Service | 5 | 5 |
| | Investigation | 5 | 5 |
| | Coherence | 5 | 5 |
| | Persona (Matthew Li / Accounting Services Partner) | 5 | 5 |
| | Business Function (Accounting Operations) | 5 | 5 |
| | Alignment w/ Today (Jun 12, 2026) | 5 | 5 |
| **Universe** | Universe Feasibility (Data Exists) | 5 | 5 (verified via verifier-fails trajectories) |
| | Cross-service Coherence | 5 | 5 |
| **Oracle Events** | OE Completeness | 3 | **5** (full critical path now covered) |
| | OE Accuracy | 5 | 5 |
| **Rubric** | Overall Rubric Quality | 1–2 (Fail, 27% Major) | **5** (0 Major, 0 Moderate) |
| | All-Failing Rubrics | N/A (no AF rubric in current runs) | N/A |
| | Rubric Category Balance | 5 | 5 (10 Outcome > 1 Process) |
| | Process Rubrics | 5 (R11 valid) | 5 |
| | Agent-Centric Phrasing | 5 | 5 (no tool names in criterion text) |
| **Trajectory** | Tool Call Count | 5 (avg ≥ 15) | 5 |
| | Agent Failure Rate | 5 (pass@1 = 0/6 ≤ 40%) | 5 |
| | Error Rate | 5 (0 errored runs) | 5 |

**Projected overall task rating: 5/5 across all dimensions.**

## 5. Candidate feedback (concise)

**Strengths:**
- Natural, partner-voice prompt that drives genuine cross-service investigation with no pre-solving or tool mentions.
- Strong scenario design: the Datadog reclass plus competing $28K vs ~$340K narratives produces real reasoning-grounded difficulty (pass@1 = 0/6 across 6 runs with no errors).
- Process rubric (R11) correctly used for ordering — the canonical case where Outcome can't capture intent.

**What to improve next time:**
- **Verify prompt premise against universe canon, not just the contested item.** The prompt opened with `"Andrea has asked for partner sign-off on a close package"`, but `Brookfield_Base_Universe/1_Summary.md:152` establishes Andrea as **the certifying partner** for Acme — she signs the monthly close herself, she doesn't ask another partner to sign. The contested item (Datadog reclass JE) was solidly grounded in the universe, but the setup framing wasn't. Initial QC missed this because trajectory runs showed agents solving the task regardless — agents focused on the investigative work and didn't push back on the false premise. **Lesson:** check both ends of the prompt — the framing claims AND the contested artifact — against the universe before scoring Truthfulness. Trajectory convergence on the contested item is necessary but not sufficient.
- **OE truncation** — the OE file was cut off mid-sentence at line 14. Always verify the file saved cleanly before submission; the partial state left rubrics 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 with no OE backing and would have been an automatic Non-Fail on OE Completeness.
- **Self-containment for write-action targets** — R6 said "the appropriate review record documentation file" without naming the system of record (Records Vault / BlackLine / JE annotation). The judge has no way to evaluate "appropriate" without universe access, which is why all 6 runs failed inconsistently. Always embed the specific write target — or list the valid alternatives — in the criterion text.
- **Self-containment for stakeholders** — R8 said "the appropriate stakeholders" without naming Andrea, Jones, Brenda. Same problem.
- **Agent-centric phrasing** — never put a tool name inside the criterion text. Tool names belong in the evidence/justification fields, where they help the evaluator cross-check but don't lock the judge's grading to a specific tool.
- **Wording / proofreading** — 5 separate typos across the rubric set ("discoverd", "Aagent", "compare" → "compares", "reviewd", "evidence f a"). One careful pass would have caught all of them; typos in rubric criteria risk being graded as Incorrect rather than Wording when severe enough to obscure intent (as happened with R2).
